# Human Segmentation Using u-net
     U-Net is a convolutional neural network architecture designed for biomedical image segmentation,including human segmentation.This project employs deep learning techniques to accurately segment human figures from images.
# overview
     This project leverages the U-Net architecture to achieve accurate human segmentation from images by effectively separating human figures from the background, the robust segmentation capabilities of U-Net facilitate more precise analyses, diagnoses, and interactive experiences.
# Installation
    To do this project,you need Python installed on system or use Google colab. Additionally, you need to install the required libraries. It can be installed using pip.
# procedure
  1.Prepare your images intended for human segmentation.
  2.Replace the image_location variable in the code with the path to your image.
  3.Execute the code.
  4.The segmented human image and its corresponding mask will be displayed, providing a clear distinction between the human figure and the background.
# Dataset
   The dataset used for the Human Segmentation Using U-Net project comprises a collection of images featuring human subjects in different poses and environments. Each image in the dataset is accompanied by an annotated ground truth mask, enabling supervised training of the U-Net model for precise segmentation. Moreover, the dataset may contain metadata like image dimensions, pixel resolution, and detailed annotations that delineate the location and boundaries of the segmented human subjects. This comprehensive dataset ensures thorough training and evaluation of the segmentation model, enhancing its accuracy and robustness.
